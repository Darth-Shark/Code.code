When the program is started, you will recieve a breif description of your current room.
You room may have up to four exits in the directions north, south, east, and west.
Up to three of these may be missing from a given room.
You may take several actions by typing commands.
To move, you may type the command "west" to move west, "north" to move north, etc.
You may also use the "look" command to see the description of your currect room again.
If you get stuck, the "look" command may occasionally find a new passage where there was none before!
To see more options, use the "help" command.
To halt the program, use the "exit" command.
Case does not matter when typing commands.
A couple of the commands have the same function. 
"west", "w", and "go west" will all function the same.
I hope you enjoy this simple game, even if you are
                                                   Still Lost.
